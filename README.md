### Minesweeper

Â© Cole Taylor 2020

A Basic C# implementation of classic Minesweeper. Uses MVC architecture, so a point-and-click GUI could be implemented fairly easily in the future by interfacing with existing controller-defined methods. 

Controls are explained in-game. You can choose to render the game board as greyscale or color. Grayscale renders faster, so it is better for larger boards.
