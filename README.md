### Minesweeper

Â© Cole Taylor 2020

A Basic C# implementation of classic Minesweeper. Uses MVC architecture, so a point-and-click GUI could be implemented fairly easily in the future by interfacing with existing controller-defined methods. 

Controls are explained in-game. Renders slowly for grid sizes >12 or so due to printing multiple colors. A faster greyscale option is a possible future improvement. 

To run, download and extract a .zip of the repository and run the compiled executable at View/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/View.exe.
